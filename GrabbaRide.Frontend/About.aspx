    <p class="justify">
        This website was established in 2008 as Palmerston North-based GrabbaRide by the
        .NET team at Massey University. The site was developed by a team of students as
        part of their third year studies for the paper 159.356 Software Engineering C.<br />
        <br />
        The software project was to develop a online car pooling system which can accommodate
        consumers day-to-day travel. The benefit of the system is affordability, by either
        cashing in on free rides, share petrol, or share costs with other users of the site.<br />
        <br />
        The project team consisted of six members:

                    Hi my name is Thomas, but everyone calls me Darcy.<br />
                    I am the oldest guy on the team. I have previously worked as a counsellor in the
                    USA and as a&nbsp; Medical Imaging Technologist. My passion is for creating software.
                    I have a focus for human factors in software and&nbsp; team interactions.</p>

                    Hi I&#39;m Nick, the second youngest member of the team. My degree is multidisciplinary,
                    but I primarily love working with software. I came into this project being the &quot;JavaScript
                    expert&quot; of the team. Despite looking horribly angry, I&#39;m not that bad (honest).</p>
